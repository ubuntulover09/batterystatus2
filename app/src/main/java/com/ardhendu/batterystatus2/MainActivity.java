                Register a BroadcastReceiver to be run in the main activity thread. The receiver will
                be called with any broadcast Intent that matches filter, in the main application thread.

                The system may broadcast Intents that are "sticky" -- these stay around after the
                broadcast as finished, to be sent to any later registrations. If your IntentFilter
                matches one of these sticky Intents, that Intent will be returned by this function
                and sent to your receiver as if it had just been broadcast.

        Parameters
            receiver : The BroadcastReceiver to handle the broadcast.
            filter : Selects the Intent broadcasts to be received.
        Returns
            The first sticky intent found that matches filter, or null if there are none.
